## Customizing Settings

1. Open Thunderbird
2. Click Menu -> Add-ons and Themes
3. Find the "Thunderbird Vericode" plugin
4. Click the "Options" button
5. In the settings page, you can:
   - Enable or disable verification code detection
   - Set the notification display time
   - Customize regex patterns for verification code detection
   - Configure keywords used to identify verification code context
   - Set up exclusion rules to filter out unwanted notifications

### Verification Code Detection

The plugin uses a context-aware approach to detect verification codes. It looks for 4-8 digit numbers that appear near context words like "code", "verification", "valid", "auth", "token", "验证码", etc.

This makes detection more accurate by only matching numbers that are likely to be verification codes based on surrounding text. You can modify this regular expression based on your needs.
